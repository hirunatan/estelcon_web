                    <h1><span>English edition</span> XX Mereth Aderthad</h1>
                    <h2>Mae Govannen!</h2>

                    <p> Welcome to the web page of the XXII annual meet of the Spanish Tolkien Society (Sociedad Tolkien Española), known as Mereth Aderthad, or plainly, EstelCon. As usual, it&rsquo;s open to both the members of the STE and the general public. Our objective, as is the case for any delegation, is to spread and enjoy J.R.R. Tolkien's work. </p>

<h2>What is a Mereth?</h2>
<p>In Sindarin –one of the elvish languages created by J.R.R. Tolkien-, Mereth literally means &quot;meeting&quot;; the plural is merith , and in the STE we use it to designate a very common activity of our smials: to gather with other members for one or more days to share and enjoy multiple activities around Tolkien's work. Usually, a Mereth is organised by a particular Smial, and lasts a weekend. During these days, we organise round-table meetings, attend conferences, play games, and enjoy almost anything that the organizing Smial may imagine. Two things that never fail are a storytelling night and a dressed up or &quot;gala&quot; dinner. This last one gets its name from the tradition in the STE of making beautiful dresses inspired by the works of Tolkien, and to wear them during that dinner. Obviously this is not compulsory, and many people don't wear any special clothes. </p>

<p>However, once a year there is a very special Mereth that gathers many members from the STE, and during which the annual General Assembly of the association is usually held. It receives always the same name: Mereth Aderthad, or &quot;Feast of Reunion&quot;. Each year a different Smial is in charge of organizing it. </p>
<h2>The Mereth Aderthad</h2>

<p>Also called EstelCon (meaning &ldquo;Convention of the Estel&rdquo;), it is a meeting held once a year, that usually lasts for four days, and in which all the society participates, because although it&rsquo;s prepared by a particular Smial –and the hard work is done by them-, activities are developed by members of the entire STE, by committees, or by other Smials. </p>

<p>The Mereth Aderthad is the greatest gathering of all members of the Sociedad Tolkien Española (plus any person who wants to join in), where we spend a few days immersed in a world of fantasy, humor, friendship and culture in multiple forms… Doing what we all love to do: reading Tolkien&rsquo;s work, telling stories based on his work, attending conferences, performing theatre plays representing passages of such work, singing and listening to songs narrating great love stories and heroic deeds, reading literary works in Quenya with sublime voices, participating in various workshops (from dressmaking to pipe smoking), or learning hobbit dances and music; even watching videos created by the members themselves. And, above all, listening to real scholars demonstrating that Tolkien is far more than one of many fantasy writers; that he is in fact one of the greatest writers ever, unfairly forgotten by some experts, who are unable to perceive the deep thoughts and humanity that impregnate his work. If there is a single thing we all agree on at a Mereth Aderthad, is the need to claim Tolkien's place in History. </p>
<p>One thing that we must never forget in every Mereth are those small presents called &quot;Mathoms&quot;. In the Lord of the Rings: About the Hobbits, J.R.R. Tolkien defines &quot;Mathoms&quot; as: «...items that Hobbits had no particular use for but could not bear to throw away...» </p>
<p>The habit in every Mereth is that the organizing Smial gives one Mathom to every attending person; the more unique, the better. &nbsp;The Smials in attendance also give a Mathom to the organizing one, as a way to thank them for the hard work done. </p>

<h2>The 


 Backdrop</h2>

<p>Also called EstelCon (meaning &ldquo;Convention of the Estel&rdquo;), it is a meeting held once a year, that usually lasts for four days, and in which all the society participates, because although it&rsquo;s prepared by a particular Smial –and the hard work is done by them-, activities are developed by members of the entire STE, by committees, or by other Smials. </p>

<p>The Mereth Aderthad is the greatest gathering of all members of the Sociedad Tolkien Española (plus any person who wants to join in), where we spend a few days immersed in a world of fantasy, humor, friendship and culture in multiple forms… Doing what we all love to do: reading Tolkien&rsquo;s work, telling stories based on his work, attending conferences, performing theatre plays representing passages of such work, singing and listening to songs narrating great love stories and heroic deeds, reading literary works in Quenya with sublime voices, participating in various workshops (from dressmaking to pipe smoking), or learning hobbit dances and music; even watching videos created by the members themselves. And, above all, listening to real scholars demonstrating that Tolkien is far more than one of many fantasy writers; that he is in fact one of the greatest writers ever, unfairly forgotten by some experts, who are unable to perceive the deep thoughts and humanity that impregnate his work. If there is a single thing we all agree on at a Mereth Aderthad, is the need to claim Tolkien's place in History. </p>
<p>One thing that we must never forget in every Mereth are those small presents called &quot;Mathoms&quot;. In the Lord of the Rings: About the Hobbits, J.R.R. Tolkien defines &quot;Mathoms&quot; as: «...items that Hobbits had no particular use for but could not bear to throw away...» </p>
<p>The habit in every Mereth is that the organizing Smial gives one Mathom to every attending person; the more unique, the better. &nbsp;The Smials in attendance also give a Mathom to the organizing one, as a way to thank them for the hard work done. </p>
<p> 

<!--p>Our tradition states that each annual convention goes around one plot or general concept.</p>

<p>In this case, both smials want to highlight those years and ages when elves and dwarves had a good relationship with each other, and created some of the most stunning works of art in Middle Earth.</p>

<p>It will be very nice that we all recall the building of the Gates of Moria, the subterranean realms of elves and dwarves or their trading relationships between their people. This mutual change and understanding brought forth many victories and songs and, although it was lost in the forthcoming ages, it was never forgotten… so it rose again in the Fourth Age.</p> 

<p>Any passage concerning dwarvish-elvish friendship and collaboration is susceptible to be studied, explored and played in our EstelCon, but we will not limit the activities to those matters. Our Mereth Aderthad will be, primarily, a gathering of friends and intellects, so we are open to any activity, lecture or workshop regarding Tolkien's works.</p-->

<h2>Activities</h2>

<p>The activity schedule is not closed as of yet, but we already have confirmed VIP Guests, conferences, workshops, music, and also demonstrations of the different projects currently being developed by people from the STE, directly related to Tolkien's works; all thus leading to a wide range of possibilities for the varying tastes of all our visitors. </p>

<p>The active Committees from the STE will be present and will encourage us to participate. We will be able to learn or improve our bow shooting; play games; take us a photo in our Gala Dinner dress; and we will sing, firstly guided by our Bards and then in the musical contest of Tolkiendili songs… </p>
<br/>

We&rsquo;ll be pleased to offer you some help, and give you several ideas for you to develop at your will.
